title: "RAGeQUIT"
---
In June 2024 I took a 1-week course in malware. Apart from a brief play with Radare with a Ghidra plugin to have a rummage around the WannaCry malware this course was mostly non-technical, with a heavy emphasis on the economics and strategy of what it takes to run a malware campaign. This was my introduction to what it means for disruptors and law enforcement to 'impose cost'. A campaign cannot be defeated until the economics are understood. The campaigns stop when it is no longer profitable to run them.

The assignment was to plan a campaign, and a strategy to mitigate that very same campaign. I conceived RAGeQUIT, a Chrome extension that deploys a crytominer. The campaign to spread the extension leans hard into LLMs, and the payload it deploys takes inspiration from ALPHV/BlackCat and WARMCOOKIE to establish persistence and evade defences. Link below.
