title: "HTTP/2 to HTTP/1 Conversion Anomalies"
---
In October 2024 I took the first course of my part-time MSc: Network Security. The course was led by the lovely <a href="https://ajpaverd.org/">Andrew Paverd</a>, who gave us fast-paced but shallow overview of security issues to be found at all levels of the OSI stack. The course was enjoyable, with an assignment that entailed a deep review of security issues in WPA2 and HTTP/2 to HTTP/1 conversion anomalies as laid out in this USENIX paper: <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22-jabiyev.pdf">https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22-jabiyev.pdf</a>. The amount of study required to adequately complete the assignment made for a great learning opportunity. Enjoyed this a great deal. Assignment linked below:
