Found my new favourite website. Some guy named Luke has become very angry at what he calls 'Soydevs' and their recipe pages filled with trackers, ads, unwanted content, comment sections, bloat, login portals, popups, and megabytes upon megabytes of Javascript. As a result he set up a static site with _very_ little styling, to open source the problem of collating online recipes. Contributions are made by GitHub pull requests. Love it. Will be contributing a chickpea curry soon. <a href="https://based.cooking">based.cooking</a>
