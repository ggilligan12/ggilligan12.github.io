2 months ago I was tasked by <a href="https://www.cybok.org/people/david-king">David King</a> with coming up with an Incident and Crisis Management procedure for a fictional Box Manufacturing company. The link below was the result. This was an interesting exercise in trying not to write _shelfware_, ie. a document whose only function is to say to an auditor that it exists, and is never read by anyone.

This provided a good opportunity to think about the importance of regular incident simulation, the distinction between incident and crisis, and how to plan for disaster without being overly prescriptive.
