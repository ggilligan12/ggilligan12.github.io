		<p>Hackathons are marathon technical building events in which a team of 4 frantically read, research and code for 24 hours straight. All to produce a 'hack', a bodged together proof of concept that depending on the execution will either make people say: "wow you made <i>that</i> in 24 hours!?" or "wow... you spent 24 hours on <i>that</i>?"<br><br>
        I attended several hackathons during my time at university. Needless to say not all went well, but I don't regret the time spent doing any. Below is a showcase of 3 that were particularly memorable and had complete outcomes. Each of these 3 hacks were done with the same team: two friends at Oxford, and one from Edinburgh.</p>

                <p>The objective was to produce a system that could procedurally generate Lo-Fi Hip-Hop Beats to Study/Relax/Hack to. Naturally we called it Lo-Fire. This was a fun hack.</p>

                <p>Here our team had the idea of putting the hexagonal 'I Demoed' stickers you earn for presenting your work at an MLH hackathon on a blockchain, and framing it in a frontend hacker profile/social network.</p>
