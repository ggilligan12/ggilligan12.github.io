For a time in ancient Athenian society the city was presided over by a figure called the Archon. The Archon would be democratically appointed, to hold the post for a year. Sometimes they were also known as the Eponymous Archon, since their names could be used to date the years, eg. 682, Creon.

After suffering defeat at the hand of oligarchic Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in the 5th century BCE, Athens was subjected to the rule of an oligarchy. A handful of men backed by Sparta, who came to be known as the Thirty Tyrants, took charge. The rule of the Tyrants was brutal, and brief. After less than a year in power they were deposed in a rebellion led by the exile Thrasybulus, and democracy was restored.

Later historians refer to the year 404 BCE, the year Athens was subdued and without a legitimate democratically appointed Archon, as "the Anarchy". So given the chance to query them: "Who was the Archon in the year of the Thirty Tyrants?", they could conceivably have replied:

"404, Archon not found"

This is a coincidence, but it brings a smile to my face to think of it as a great easter egg of the internet.

Oh by the way this _is_ an actual 404 error, your page wasn't found. Sorry.
