For a time in ancient Athenian society the city was presided over by figures called Archons. At any given time there may have been one such figure, or many. By the 5th century BCE a convention had been established: one democratically appointed Eponymous Archon, to hold the post for a year. 

After suffering defeat at the hand of oligarchic Sparta in the Peloponnesian War, Athens was subjected to the rule of an oligarchy. A handful of men backed by Sparta, who came to be known as the Thirty Tyrants, took charge. The rule of the Tyrants was brutal, and brief. They were deposed after less than a year in power by a rebellion led by the exile Thrasybulus, and democracy was restored.

Sophocles refers to the year 404 BCE, the year Athens was subdued and without an Archon, as "the Anarchy". So if you had the chance to query him: "Who was the Archon in the year of the Thirty Tyrants?", he could conceivably have replied:

"404, Archon not found"


This is a coincidence, but it brings a smile to my face to think of it as a great easter egg of the internet.

Oh also unless you clicked on this as a post this _is_ an actual 404 error, your page wasn't found. Sorry.
