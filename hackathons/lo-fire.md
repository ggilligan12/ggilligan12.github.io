In November 2019 our team attended the Oxford Hack for the second time. Both of my teammates at Oxford were now on organising committee so we were ineligible for prizes. This didn't stop us from having fun with a good idea: procedurally generated lo-fi beats, inspired by the inimitable "Lo-Fi Beats to Study/Relax to" playlist. My contribution was the atmospheric noise layer of the sound. This just involved randomly stitching and crossfading some .mp3 samples I found and delivering the .wav file to the core of the application which assembled the layers into a track. The music we produced was a bit same-y, but not half bad:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<audio controls>
    <source src="/assets/same-y_music.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
</div>

This was a nice project. As with most things I've left half finished I wouldn't mind returning to this someday to improve the quality and diversity of beats produced. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A">here</a> to get an idea of what we were going for.
