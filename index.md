This website was brought to life by Jekyll, a Ruby gem that consumes Markdown and uses Liquid Templating to produce maintainable static pages. The theme is called 'Forty', and was designed by HTML5 UP. Integration of the theme with Jekyll was provided by Andrew Banchich and hosting is provided by GitHub pages.
