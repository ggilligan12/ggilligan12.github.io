This static website was brought to life by Jekyll, a Ruby gem that creates an executable environment through which editing and maintaining a page is as simple as filling in text boxes and uploading pictures. The theme is called 'Forty', and was designed by HTML5 UP. Integration of the theme with Jekyll was provided by Andrew Banchich and hosting is provided by GitHub pages.
